# Deployment Instructions for kodofeeds.com

## What I Fixed

1. **Router Issue**: Changed from `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter` for GitHub Pages compatibility
2. **Build Process**: Updated build script to include CNAME file in dist folder
3. **GitHub Actions**: Created automated deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
4. **Domain Configuration**: Ensured CNAME file is properly configured for kodofeeds.com

## Manual Deployment Steps

If you want to deploy manually:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

## Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy your site when you push to the main branch.

To enable this:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Go to Settings > Pages
3. Set Source to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select "gh-pages" branch
5. Click Save

## Domain Configuration

Your custom domain `kodofeeds.com` should work automatically once:
1. The CNAME file is in place (âœ… Done)
2. Your domain DNS is pointing to GitHub Pages
3. The site is deployed

## Testing

The site should now work correctly at:
- https://kodofeeds.com (your custom domain)
- https://yourusername.github.io/kodofeeds (GitHub Pages URL)

## What the HashRouter Change Means

- URLs will now have a `#` in them (e.g., `kodofeeds.com/#/about`)
- This is necessary for GitHub Pages to work properly with client-side routing
- All navigation will still work seamlessly

The site should now load correctly without showing a blank page!
